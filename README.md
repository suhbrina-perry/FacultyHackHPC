# FacultyHackHPC

## Target Course Name
**CS423 - Introduction to Cybersecurity**

## Team Name: Crypto Squad

## Team Members:
- Sabrina Perry, **KeyCracker**  
  Mississippi Valley State University
- Dr. Izzat Alsmadi, **Code Enforcer**  
  Texas A&M, San Antonio
- Dr. Fernando Posada, **Byte Master**  
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory

## Target Course Goals:
- **Introduce fundamental concepts of Cybersecurity and HPC**  
  The course will cover essential cybersecurity topics such as **threats**, **cryptography**, and **data protection**. HPC resources will be introduced to help accelerate problem-solving tasks within cybersecurity contexts.
  
- **Create hands-on lab exercises for students**  
  Practical exercises will be designed to allow students to use tools that speed up cybersecurity tasks, including running programs on multiple computers simultaneously and leveraging cloud services to analyze datasets. *(How fun will this be!)*

- **Implement HPC for cryptography and machine learning**  
  Lab exercises will demonstrate how HPC can be used to accelerate **cryptographic algorithms** and **machine learning models** for threat detection. Students will implement basic encryption algorithms or machine learning techniques to detect potential cybersecurity threats. *(What HPC tools can be used to achieve this?)*

- **Find relevant datasets for cybersecurity**  
  Identify datasets that are applicable to cybersecurity for use in labs and exercises.
